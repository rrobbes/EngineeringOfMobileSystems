# Navigation practice

The goal of this lab is to practice navigation. To do so, take the [solution of the project](../project1-flashy/Solution.js), and add navigation to it, using as reference the material in the navigation classes:
- Basics of [Navigation](../lec8-navigation/)
- [Adding Navigation](../lec9-more-navigation/) to an existing app.

You can experiment with restructuring the app to add navigations with switch, tabs, or stack navigators, as you see fit. If you want, you may want to experiment with Drawers as well.
