# Minimal git resources:

There is a recommended tutorial for git on bitbucket:
- Create an account on https://bitbucket.org 
- Install Git on your computer
- Follow https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud

Further exercises:
- Clone the repository to your local hard drive into folder 1 (to simulate user 1)
- Clone the repository to your local hard drive into folder 2 (to simulate user 2)
- Imitate a conflict (user 1 pushes, user 2 tries to push, fails)
- Resolve conflict (open the file in conflict, fix it and commit/push the merge; try it also opening the conflicting file in Visual Studio Code to learn how to fix conflicts with such a tool)
- Repeat the steps 3 and 4 so that you perfectly understand the steps to resolve Git conflicts


For github, there are additional resources here:

# Practicing Typescript

There are a few resources to practice typescript itself:

Go through the tutorials we've seen in the lecture, and experiment yourself:
- [Typescript in five minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html): A five-minutes high-level overview. 
- [A nice tutorial](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/typescript/): this one is a bit longer than the "official" one, and cover a few more basic Typescript concepts.
- [Typescript and React](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html): tutorial on Typescript and how it works with React.

The next step would be to take your code from the previous project, and type it:
- create a new expo typescript project
- copy the files from the previous project there
- rename them from .js to .tsx 
- start typing!
